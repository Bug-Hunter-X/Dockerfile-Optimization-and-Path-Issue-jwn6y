This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: using a bulky base image and inefficient package management.  The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest` which downloads the entire Ubuntu system.  The improved version uses a slimmer base image and shows proper cleanup with `apt-get clean` and `apt-get autoremove`.  Additionally, it fixes a path issue in the `CMD` instruction. This leads to significant improvements in image size, build times, and image reliability.
